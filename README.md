### **Ball Aerospace** | Broomfield, CO

#### SDA Mission Analyst – Systems Engineer
*February 2020 – March 2023*

- Technical lead, architect, and developer of a flexible scheduling/optimization framework combining abstracted variants of decision making models, cooperative behavior heuristics, and machine learning-based optimization techniques
- Leveraged this scheduling/optimization framework to conceptually design and improve multi-satellite constellations capable of asserting cislunar space domain awareness objectives. This framework was utilized to determine constellation size, orbit configurations, payload sensitivities, sensing phenomenology, and observation tasking across all sensors, optimizing via SDA-specific cost functions
- Led the development of a tool capable of generating synthetic inter-satellite observations and multi-target tracking based on probabilistic data association, multi-sensor fusion, and sequential state estimation
- Developed and leveraged a radiometric modeling tool intended for estimating the system performance of space-based Electro-Optical/Infra-Red sensors
